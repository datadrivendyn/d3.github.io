excerpt: "**A community of dynamicists that use data-driven methods for system identification, behaviour prediction and control.** \n
D3 is an initiative that grew out of a workshop at Bosch in early 2023. Our aim is to bring together people that are interested in data-driven approaches to dynamical processes, particularly (but not limited to) nonlinear structural dynamics. We are >50 people from academia and industry that are driven by a passion for dynamics and data-driven approaches."
