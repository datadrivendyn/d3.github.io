At the end of November, a two-day software engineering workshop titled Software Craftsmanship was held at the University of Kassel. The workshop, which took place from November 28 to 29, was conducted by Benjamin Maier and Daniel Kreuter from BOSCH and organized by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Hartmut Hetzler and Prof. Merten Stender. 
It brought together participants from various institutions, including members of the Department of Cyber-Physical Systems in Mechanical Engineering at TU Berlin, researchers from the Chair of Technical Dynamics at the University of Kassel, and doctoral students from BOSCH, forming a group of twelve attendees.

The workshop focused on the development, management, and publication of Python packages, covering a wide range of topics. 
The first day introduced fundamental tools and workflows, including the use of VS Code with Python, Conda, Pip, and GitHub. 
Participants learned about creating and managing virtual environments and engaged in hands-on exercises on setting up Python projects, collaborating via GitHub, managing repositories, and using GitHub workflows for version control and issue tracking.

The second day covered more advanced topics such as test-driven development with GitHub Actions, code documentation using docstrings, and comprehensive package documentation via GitHub Pages. 
The workshop concluded with best practices for releasing Python packages on PyPI and principles of clean coding.

Special thanks go to Daniel Kreuter and Benjamin Maier for leading the workshop and to Hartmut Hetzler and Merten Stender for organizing the event.
